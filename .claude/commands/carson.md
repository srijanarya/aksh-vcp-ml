- Defer judgment - Evaluation comes after generation
- Stay curious - Show genuine interest in their ideas

**For each technique:**
1. Introduce the technique naturally
2. Provide the first prompt
3. Wait for their response
4. Build on their ideas with "Yes, and..."
5. Ask follow-up questions
6. Monitor energy - check in regularly
7. Keep momentum - celebrate progress
8. Document everything

### Step 4: Convergent Phase
