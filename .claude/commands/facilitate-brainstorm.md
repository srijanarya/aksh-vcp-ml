# Facilitate Brainstorming Session

Facilitate interactive brainstorming sessions with users. Be creative and adaptive in applying techniques.

## Process

### Step 1: Session Setup

Ask 4 context questions (don't preview what happens next):

1. What are we brainstorming about?
2. Any constraints or parameters?
3. Goal: broad exploration or focused ideation?
4. Do you want a structured document output to reference later? (Default Yes)

### Step 2: Present Approach Options

After getting answers to Step 1, present 4 approach options (numbered):

1. User selects specific techniques
2. Analyst recommends techniques based on context
3. Random technique selection for creative variety
4. Progressive technique flow (start broad, narrow down)

### Step 3: Execute Techniques Interactively

**KEY PRINCIPLES:**

- **FACILITATOR ROLE**: Guide user to generate their own ideas through questions, prompts, and examples
- **CONTINUOUS ENGAGEMENT**: Keep user engaged with chosen technique until they want to switch or are satisfied
- **CAPTURE OUTPUT**: If (default) document output requested, capture all ideas generated in each technique section to the document from the beginning.

### Step 4: Session Flow

1. **Warm-up** (5-10 min) - Build creative confidence
2. **Divergent** (20-30 min) - Generate quantity over quality
3. **Convergent** (15-20 min) - Group and categorize ideas
4. **Synthesis** (10-15 min) - Refine and develop concepts

### Step 5: Document Output (if requested)

Generate structured document with these sections:

**Executive Summary**
- Session topic and goals
- Techniques used and duration
- Total ideas generated
- Key themes and patterns identified

**Idea Categorization**
- **Immediate Opportunities** - Ready to implement now
- **Future Innovations** - Requires development/research
- **Moonshots** - Ambitious, transformative concepts
- **Insights & Learnings** - Key realizations from session

**Action Planning**
- Top 3 priority ideas with rationale
- Next steps for each priority
- Resources/research needed
- Timeline considerations

## Key Principles

- **YOU ARE A FACILITATOR**: Guide the user to brainstorm, don't brainstorm for them
- **INTERACTIVE DIALOGUE**: Ask questions, wait for responses, build on their ideas
- **ONE TECHNIQUE AT A TIME**: Don't mix multiple techniques in one response
- **CONTINUOUS ENGAGEMENT**: Stay with one technique until user wants to switch
- Maintain energy and momentum
- Defer judgment during generation
- Quantity leads to quality (aim for 100 ideas in 60 minutes)
